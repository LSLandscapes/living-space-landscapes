			'Scott and the Living Spaces team did a great job entirely redoing our landscaping several years ago. We also use them on an annual basis to refresh the mulch and tidy up the landscaping. Highly recommend them.',

		review: `From our first meeting with Megan, we knew that we were working with  consummate professionals. She listened, took notes, made suggestions and came back within days to present outstanding sketches of a perfect landscaping plan. When the project was completed, she had transformed a barren construction site into a stunning landscaping masterpiece. The final results far surpassed our expectations. We strongly recommend Megan and her team of professionals. As an unexpected bonus, she came back in the fall to have the young trees taped to protect them against sub-zero Minnesota winters.`,

		review: `Several years ago, a friend of the family had some landscaping done by Living Space Landscapes and recommended them to me. My wife and I worked with them on a full-scale re-design of our back yard after I accidentally killed all our grass by over-fertilizing it. Whoops. Oh well, the backyard needed a lot of work anyway and this provided a good excuse for us to do it right. Scott Solomonson stopped by to discuss the project and listened carefully to our goals for the space and discussed our options. A few weeks later he provided us with a design, including a patio, and after some back and forth we decided to move forward with the project. Now, years later, we still couldnâ€™t be happier. The plantings and trees have all grown in and it looks awesome! That summer and fall, and every spring, summer and fall since, our patio and backyard becomes our second living room.
        In the fall of 2020, we reached out to Scott again to do some landscaping in our front yard this this time. We wanted to add a sitting space and landscape the surrounding area. This time Megan stopped out to discuss the project, our goals, our budget and the timeline. After a few weeks she came by with the design and after some refinements and tweaks, we agreed to have the work done in the spring of 2021. As agreed, early that spring Scott and his awesome crew stopped by and again and did a great job! That was around 10 months ago now and we are really looking forward to being outside again as we watch another St. Paul, Minnesota winter melt into the Mississippi.`,
